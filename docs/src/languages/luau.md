## Configuration

Configuration instructions are available in the [Luau Vector Extension README](https://github.com/4teapo/vector-luau).

## Formatting

To support automatically formatting your code, you can use [JohnnyMorganz/StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua), a Lua code formatter.

Install with:

```sh
# macOS via Homebrew
brew install stylua
# Or via Cargo
cargo install stylua --features lua52,lua53,lua54,luau
```

Then add the following to your Vector `settings.json`:

```json [settings]
  "languages": {
    "Luau": {
      "formatter": {
        "external": {
          "command": "stylua",
          "arguments": ["-"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
