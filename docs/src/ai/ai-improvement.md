# Vector AI Data & Privacy

This fork does not include a hosted AI service and does not upload prompts or source code to Vector-operated servers.

When you configure an AI provider (for example via an API key), Vector sends requests directly to that provider. Review the provider's terms and privacy policy to understand how your data may be used.

Vector does not collect usage analytics in this fork.
