# Vector on Windows

Vector is not supported on Windows (yet). We have limited developer bandwidth, and a
new platform is a large undertaking. However, the community has developed
a build of Vector on Windows, and you can compile it yourself with these instructions:

- [Building for Windows](./development/windows.md)

For now, improvements to Windows support are best tracked in your fork's issue tracker.
